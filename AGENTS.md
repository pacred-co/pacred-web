# Pacred — agent behavior rules

> AGENTS.md is loaded into every Claude Code session via `@AGENTS.md` at the top of `CLAUDE.md`. Keep this file narrow: rules that change *how* agents behave, not project facts (facts live in CLAUDE.md / docs/).

## 0a. Workflow vs UI — the design philosophy (read FIRST · 2026-05-23 added)

**Legacy PCS Cargo = workflow source of truth. Our UI = our design — better than legacy.**

We are NOT pixel-cloning the PHP. We are stealing the **logic** (data fields ·
button behaviour · filters · permissions · status flows) and applying **our
own polish** (Tailwind · Lucide icons · cleaner typography · responsive design ·
better empty states). The owner's quote: *"เราแค่ copy ระบบการทำงาน ส่วนหน้าตา
เราเอามาปรับให้สวยเอง"* (we copy the working system, polish the look ourselves).

Before shipping any faithful-port page:
1. **Open the legacy `.php`** under `C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\newrealdatapcs\pcscargo\member\` (customer · 42 `.php`) or `...\member\pcs-admin\` (admin · 187 `.php`) — confirmed live 2026-06-04 — and list every data field + button + filter
2. **Write the Pacred page with the SAME logic but our design** — never copy Bootstrap-4 markup verbatim
3. **Browser-verify side-by-side** with the legacy (open the owner's screenshot OR render the PHP locally) — add anything legacy shows that we don't
4. **Banner deferred features in the UI** ("Wave 12 ยังไม่เปิด — ใช้ legacy PHP ชั่วคราว") instead of silently linking to a redirect
5. **Tell ภูม what's complete vs what's stubbed** when reporting wave completion — don't make ภูม discover gaps by clicking around
6. **Ask before implementing if unsure** — "should the thumbnail link to full image or detail page?"

**Anti-pattern (what NOT to do):** Ship a "faithful port" with the legacy's
plain Bootstrap-4 chrome and defend it as "matches legacy". Wait for ภูม to
flag mismatches instead of proactively comparing. Silently leave features
unimplemented without bannering.

## 0b. Deep-audit from source — NEVER trust an HTML paste or screenshot (2026-05-25 added)

When ภูม pastes a legacy HTML render, or shows a screenshot, or describes a workflow — the **source of truth is the legacy PHP file on disk**, not the rendered HTML. Every legacy `pcs-admin/*.php` is usually a multi-mode dispatcher (`switch ($_GET['page'])` · `if (isset($_GET['id']))` · `if (isset($_POST['*']))`); the HTML you see is ONE mode of N. The other modes are invisible until you `Read` the source.

This rule exists because on 2026-05-25 I shipped a fidelity-comparison report that missed 2 huge legacy pages (`report-cnt.php?id=` mode-b + `forwarder-check.php`) because I compared against ภูม's pasted HTML instead of opening the PHP. ภูม said: *"โหนี่ขนาดมี source code ให้นายเลยนะ ไล่ deep audit เพิ่มด่วน — อยากส่งงานแล้วโดน Owner ไล่กลับบ้านหรือไง"*. Owner would have rejected the work.

**Mandatory protocol when ภูม asks "does this match" or "is this faithful":**
1. **Open the legacy PHP** under `C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\newrealdatapcs\pcscargo\member\pcs-admin\` (admin · 187 `.php`) or `...\pcscargo\member\` (customer · 42 `.php`) — **confirmed live 2026-06-04** (legacy root also holds the customer DB dumps `2026-*-pcsc_main.sql` + `database-member/`/`database-backoffice/` + rate-card `.xlsx`). The old docs said `D:\REALSHITDATAPCS\...` or `C:\Users\Admin\Downloads\newrealdatapcs\...` — **both are stale/wrong on this machine; use the Desktop path.**
2. **List every mode** the file dispatches (grep `$_GET` / `$_POST` / `switch (` / `include 'include/pages/`)
3. **Enumerate every `include/pages/<dir>/*.php` sub-handler** — each is potentially a separate Pacred server action
4. **Cross-reference Pacred** for every legacy artifact (`Glob app/[locale]/(admin)/admin/<feature>/**`)
5. **Build the diff table** (legacy file · LOC · mode · pacred path · status ✅/⚠️/❌/🔧) BEFORE answering
6. **Use parallel agents** when scope is wide (> 10 legacy files) — agent A enumerates legacy, agent B enumerates Pacred, you produce the diff

Executable form: [`.claude/skills/legacy-fidelity-check/SKILL.md`](.claude/skills/legacy-fidelity-check/SKILL.md).

**Anti-patterns (what NOT to do):**
- ❌ Comparing only to "what I see in the HTML" — HTML shows one mode
- ❌ Defending a gap as "intentional Pacred UX divergence" without verifying Pacred has the feature at all
- ❌ Trusting your own previous audit's framing — re-audit from source for any new question
- ❌ Saying "~85% complete" without per-file accounting — measure or don't claim

## 0d. Reachability — every function MUST have a clickable entry point (2026-05-30 added · owner directive)

Owner: *"ทุกฟังชั่น ต้องมีปุ่ม หรือทางเข้า ให้เข้าถึง เข้าใช้ได้หมดนะ ไม่งั้นจะทำมาทำไม เข้าถึงก็ยาก ก็ไม่ได้หนะ"* — every function / page / server-action MUST be reachable from the running UI via a clear entry point (sidebar item · top-menu link · row-action button · dashboard card · parent-page button). A feature that exists, type-checks, and even writes the right table is **useless if no one can click their way to it**. Hard-to-reach counts as fail too — the path must be obvious, ≤3 clicks from the sidebar/dashboard.

This is the **3rd audit dimension** (after: 1=does the function exist, 2=does it write the right `tb_*` table / correct flow-order). A function can pass 1+2 and still be invisible. The 2026-05-30 master gap audit ([`docs/research/legacy-gap-2026-05-30/_MASTER.md`](docs/research/legacy-gap-2026-05-30/_MASTER.md) §8) found this is a real, recurring failure: the faithful `submitCartOrder` is orphaned (`/cart` has no nav), `adminUpdateYuanPayment` + the service-order update form are mounted on no UI the real rows reach, admin print has no route, customer address buttons are inert. The deleted rebuilt address-manager (branch `cleanup/dead-address-stack`) was a pure orphan.

**Mandatory — every port/fix ships its entry point IN THE SAME CHANGE:**
1. When you build/port a function, wire its nav entry (sidebar / menu / row-button / card) in the same diff — never "backend now, nav later" (Wave 7.3 had to retro-wire 12 orphan admin pages).
2. **Definition of done:** you can click from the sidebar/dashboard to the feature in ≤3 clicks. If you can only reach it by typing the URL, it's not done.
3. This strengthens §0c: the click-through verification MUST start at the real entry point (sidebar→page→action), not `curl /the/url`.
4. When auditing/reviewing: any route under `(admin)/admin/*` or `(protected)/*` with **zero inbound `<Link href>` / sidebar entry / button** is an orphan → wire it or delete it.

**Anti-patterns:** shipping a working server-action with no button · "the page exists, just go to /admin/x/y" · leaving a feature reachable only by guessing the URL · backend-first with nav deferred to "next wave".

Rule captured in memory `reachability_rule_2026_05_30`.

## 0c. Verify-deep-flow — never claim "clean" without clicking the row (2026-05-25 ค่ำ added)

A page returning HTTP 200 from `curl` is NOT proof it works. A list/table that renders 14 columns isn't done if column 14 is invisible behind a hidden Windows scrollbar. A detail page that says `export const dynamic = "force-dynamic"` and exists on disk isn't done if it 404s intermittently because of a silent Supabase query failure.

This rule exists because on 2026-05-25 ค่ำ I reported Wave 18 as **"clean · no bugs · no dead flows"** after smoke-testing only the routes — and ภูม found 2 bugs within minutes: `/admin/customers` table cut off (scrollbar invisible on Windows Chrome) + `/admin/customers/PR10899` intermittent 404 (legacy-view.tsx silently swallowed db error). ภูม said: *"ทำไมไม่รีเช็คหรือไม่บอกภูมิว่าหน้าไหนยังไม่มี ... ภูมิต้องมาคอยหาเจอเอง ... แบบนี้มันเหมือนเราทำงานกันลวกๆไม่เรียบร้อยเลยนะ ... เราจะทำยังไงดีให้เราทั้งคู่และคอมที่ทำงานด้วย ไม่พลาด ไม่ตกหล่น"*. **2 bugs got past the gate because the gate only checked "does the URL respond 200" — not "does the user-visible flow work end-to-end".**

**Mandatory protocol before claiming any list/table/detail page "clean" or "done":**

1. **Route smoke (existing — necessary but NOT sufficient).** `curl` every new/changed route → 200/307. This catches `DYNAMIC_SERVER_USAGE` and dead routes; it does NOT catch UI clipping, silent db errors, or broken interactive flows.
2. **Click-through the primary row action.** For every list/table page: open it in Chrome MCP, click the first row → verify the detail page renders (NOT 404, NOT 500, NOT spinner-forever). For each row-action button (edit · approve · suspend · view-as-customer · ดู · etc.): click → verify response (toast / navigation / state change). A 404 on row-click = the row's data field doesn't match the detail route's lookup column — that's a port bug, not a "row data missing" excuse.
3. **Measure horizontal overflow + verify visible scrollbar.** For every wide table (≥ 8 columns), run in Chrome devtools / MCP eval: `document.querySelector('.overflow-x-auto').scrollWidth > document.querySelector('.overflow-x-auto').clientWidth`. If true → either columns fit at the tested viewport OR a visible scrollbar must be present. Windows Chrome hides scrollbars by default — use the `.scrollbar-x-visible` class (globals.css) or add a UI hint ("เลื่อนซ้าย-ขวา ⇆") so staff know to scroll.
4. **Destructure `error` from EVERY Supabase query.** Never write `const { data } = await admin.from(...)`. Always `const { data, error } = ...`; on error → `console.error(...)` with the userid/query context AND `throw` (so Next renders a real error boundary, not a silent null → 404). The 2026-05-25 `/customers/PR10899` intermittent 404 was exactly this — `maybeSingle()` quietly returned `data=null` on a transient PgBouncer timeout, and `if (!data) return null` → `notFound()` → 404 for a row that exists.
5. **State explicitly: verified vs not-yet-verified.** When reporting wave completion to ภูม, list per-surface: `✅ verified flow X→Y→Z`, `⚠️ rendered but didn't click action button A`, `❌ not opened at all`. Never say "clean" or "all green" if any item is ⚠️ or ❌. The honest sentence is *"3 of 5 surfaces I click-verified, 2 only smoke-tested — those 2 may have interactive bugs I didn't catch"*. ภูม would rather know what's untested than be told it's clean and find out the hard way.

**Concrete miss-case that justified this rule:**
- I shipped Wave 18 + ran `curl` on all routes (all 200) + did NOT click the eye-icon on a customer row + did NOT measure table overflow. ภูม opened `/admin/customers`, scrolled visually, saw the "จัดการ" column missing → bug 1. ภูม clicked the eye-icon on PR10899 → 404 → bug 2. **Both were 60-second checks I skipped.** The route-smoke discipline (AGENTS.md §11 → `phase-verify-loop` skill) was followed; it was insufficient.

**Anti-patterns:**
- ❌ Claiming "wave clean" because `pnpm verify` + route-smoke pass
- ❌ `const { data } = await admin.from(...)` — error path is invisible
- ❌ Letting the user discover interactive bugs by clicking around
- ❌ Wide tables (≥ 8 cols) without `.scrollbar-x-visible` or a "⇆ scroll" hint
- ❌ Detail pages that fall through to `notFound()` when the underlying issue is a transient db error (notFound = "row doesn't exist", not "I had a problem reading")

## 0e. Reachable dead-write TRAPS — verify the CONSUMER's table before trusting an edit (2026-06-01 · from the big audit)

The big audit (`docs/research/big-audit-2026-06-01/_MASTER-PLAN.md`) found the most dangerous residual bug class: a **reachable admin surface wired to a 0-row rebuilt table** while the real consumers read the legacy `tb_*` twin. Staff edit → green toast → **nothing changes** (silent wrong-data). Worse than a missing feature — it erodes trust + can mis-state money. Confirmed live: `/admin/settings` yuan_rate (fixed this session), `/admin/rates/vip`, the 3 commission pages (`/admin/commissions`·`/withdrawals`·`/forwarder-sales` — 4,104 real earns invisible).

**Rule — before claiming an admin write-surface "works", or when porting/reviewing one:**
1. Grep what table the WRITE action targets (`from("X")` / `.update` / `.insert`).
2. Grep what table the READER/consumer reads (the customer page, the cron, the pricing engine, the report).
3. If they differ (write→rebuilt twin, read→`tb_*`) → it's a dead-write trap. Repoint the write to the live `tb_*`, OR remove the surface, OR banner it. Never leave a reachable edit that no-ops.
4. Quick prod check: a rebuilt table with **0 rows** is almost always the dead twin; the populated `tb_*` is canonical (147 of 263 tables are rebuilt — most are empty seeds).

This sharpens §0c (verify-deep-flow) + §0d (reachability): a surface can be reachable AND render AND 200 AND still silently write nothing. The cheapest trust win is a "Potemkin sweep" of these.

> **New long-term SOT:** the faithful-port era is closing (legacy `tb_*` canonical, money loop closed, forwarder ~90%). The next era = activate the data (BI + omni-CRM + automation + the CargoThai supply-chain platform). Plan: `docs/research/big-audit-2026-06-01/_MASTER-PLAN.md`; per-lane handoff: `docs/handoff-2026-06-01-waves.md`.

## 0f. Product-quality concept — confirm-before-mutate · accurate badges · linked + reachable for all roles · no-regression perf (2026-06-04 · owner directive)

Owner's standing quality bar ("เป๊ะคม") for every surface — customer, staff, AND partner. Full record: memory `ui_quality_concept_2026_06_04`. Treat as a checklist on every surface you touch:

1. **Confirm before mutate (กันคนลั่น / user-error).** Any action that fills / edits / submits / deletes / approves MUST show a dialog (Confirm / Cancel / OK / explicit edit-mode) BEFORE it fires — never silent instant-mutate on a single click. Reusable: `components/ui/pacred-dialog.tsx` + `useConfirmDialogs`. A mutate-button with no confirm = a defect.
2. **Badge / notification numbers EXACT — อย่ามั่ว.** Every count/badge must equal the live `tb_*` query it claims to represent (not a rebuilt-twin 0-row count, not stale). If you surface a number, verify its source.
3. **Linked + reachable + useful for all 3 roles.** Data links correctly + completely across the system and is used to the max; every function is ≤3-click reachable (§0d) for staff · customer · **partner**.
4. **Perf without regression.** The platform is slow ("ช้า·หน่วง·ทุกคนบ่น"). Hunt + fix lag (performance-hunter skill, measure-then-fix) — but **ห้ามทำงานบัค งานหาย** (NEVER introduce a bug or lose work; verify every perf change doesn't regress). This is the #1 guardrail.
5. **Profile picture must actually work** — customer (wired 2026-06-04) AND staff/admin (TODO) — and be upload-tested, not just render-checked.

Gate discipline (learned 2026-06-04): NEVER pipe a gate through `| tail` — the pipe's exit code masks the real one (a build can fail while the wrapper reports 0). Use `pnpm build > /tmp/x 2>&1; echo $?` and read the real exit code before claiming green or pushing.

## 0. Current direction — D1: Pacred is a faithful PCS Cargo port

On **2026-05-18 the owner rejected the rebuilt-from-scratch Pacred app** — its UI and workflow look nothing like the legacy **PCS Cargo** system that staff and ~8,898 customers use daily. The direction is now **D1: Pacred becomes the legacy PCS Cargo system, faithfully — rebranded `PCS` → `PR`.** This is the canonical lens for every task. Three phases:

- **Phase A — Data migration. ✅ DONE.** Ported `pcsc_main` (117 tables) into Supabase, `PCS<n>` → `PR<n>`. *All 117 tables loaded on dev + prod — the 3 oversized log tables (`tb_web_hs`/`tb_history_key`/`tb_history`) backfilled after ก๊อต's Supabase Pro upgrade · customer image + storage files uploaded to Supabase S3 production (`pcsracgo/public/member`) by ภูม 2026-05-24 · ~8,898 customers · orders · wallets · ตู้ reconciled.*
- **Phase B — Workflow fidelity** — rework the customer portal + admin back-office so menus, job statuses, container (ตู้) flow, and the end-to-end logic-loop match legacy PCS exactly. Goal: **zero retraining** for staff and customers. *Wave 1 integrated on `dave`; waves 2+ in progress.*
- **Phase C — Pacred enhancements** — layer Pacred's own improvements *only after* the faithful port works. The old Tier 0/1/2/3 roadmap + the Phase-2 build queue are **deferred to Phase C — not cancelled.**

📋 Canonical SOT: **[`docs/decisions/0017-pacred-faithful-pcs-port.md`](docs/decisions/0017-pacred-faithful-pcs-port.md)** (the D1 decision) + **[`docs/UPGRADE_PLAN.md`](docs/UPGRADE_PLAN.md)** (the D1 master phase plan — current state · stages · work-lanes). Read ADR-0017 in full before D1 work. In-flight pre-D1 feature work (e.g. BK-1 booking flow, freight V-E1.1) pauses; the team pivots to Phase B.

**2026-05-19 evening — the faithful-port lane.** Phase B is now executed as a literal **1:1 transcription** of the legacy PHP screens (the owner's "100% sameness FIRST" rule). The work runs on a dedicated branch loop — `Poom-pacred` (ภูม · admin) + `dave-pacred` (เดฟ · customer) → `faithful-port` (production) → `main`; `dave`/`Poom` are FROZEN. The plan + branch model + 4-person work-split → **[`docs/runbook/faithful-port-plan.md`](docs/runbook/faithful-port-plan.md)**; the method → **[`docs/runbook/faithful-port-transcription.md`](docs/runbook/faithful-port-transcription.md)**.

## 1. Session-start handshake (MANDATORY — do BEFORE asking what to work on)

After `git fetch` + branch sync at the top of a session, run this handshake **proactively** — do not wait for the user to ask. Skipping = wandering session + forcing the user to re-explain context they already encoded in docs.

**Step 1 — Read your role brief** ([`docs/briefs/<your-name>.md`](docs/briefs/) — routing in [`docs/briefs/INDEX.md`](docs/briefs/INDEX.md)).

**Step 2 — Scan canonical context** (parallel reads):
- [`docs/decisions/0017-pacred-faithful-pcs-port.md`](docs/decisions/0017-pacred-faithful-pcs-port.md) — D1, the current direction (see §0)
- [`docs/STRATEGY.md`](docs/STRATEGY.md) — master single-read consolidation (~370 lines)
- [`docs/UPGRADE_PLAN.md`](docs/UPGRADE_PLAN.md) — the D1 phase plan (Phase A migration → Phase B workflow fidelity → Phase C) + work-split
- [`docs/learnings/_index.md`](docs/learnings/_index.md) — new entries since last session (immortal-scholar — `.claude/skills/scholar-immortal/`)
- Your brief's "Force-read" cross-links (relevant ADRs, runbooks)

**Step 3 — Surface a state summary to the user** (don't ask first — present it):
- 🟢 **Shipped** — what's behind us (1-3 lines, latest sprint)
- 🟡 **Your pickup list** — top 3-5 P0/P1 from your brief
- 🔴 **Critical blockers** — who you're blocked on, who's blocked on you
- **Recommended first task** — highest-leverage P0 with effort estimate

**Step 4 — Wait for user go-ahead** before implementing. They may redirect to a different pickup.

**Triggers:** any session that starts with sync ("ต่อที่ทำงาน", "เปิดมาใหม่", new worktree, machine change, fresh Claude Code window). Per memory `session_start_handshake`.

## 2. Faithfulness-first lens (D1 — supersedes the revenue-first framing for Phase A/B)

Under D1 the decision lens shifts: Phase A/B work is about making Pacred **be** the working PCS system. For every task ask — **does this make the port more faithful, and the system usable with zero retraining for staff and customers?** Prefer work that closes the gap between Pacred and legacy PCS; de-prioritise anything that adds Pacred-original behaviour (that's Phase C). When porting, **match the legacy PCS workflow exactly** — don't "improve" menus, statuses, or the logic-loop mid-port; faithful first, enhance later.

The old revenue lens (more **true** / **billable** / **measurable**) still holds underneath — a faithful PCS port *is* the billable revenue path — but during Phase A/B "faithful + zero-retraining" is the tie-breaker.

**Plan work properly.** Don't ship half-built to chase a deadline; don't skip the quality gate to "save time".

**⚠️ 2026-05-19 — owner escalation.** The owner reviewed the team's output and **scolded the whole team** — screens were still diverging from legacy PCS. The rule, verbatim: **"ต้องเอาของเดิมมา copy ให้ได้ ให้เหมือนทั้งหมด 100% ก่อน แล้วเราค่อยพัฒนาให้เหนือยิ่งกว่า"** — copy the original to 100% sameness FIRST, then improve. **Applies to everything.** Before shipping any Phase-B rework, run the **`legacy-fidelity-check`** skill — the executable form of this rule. A genuine improvement idea → record it for Phase C; never ship it inside a port diff (it hides divergence in a good-looking change).

📋 D1 work is sequenced in [`docs/UPGRADE_PLAN.md`](docs/UPGRADE_PLAN.md) — the D1 phase plan (Phase A migration → Phase B workflow fidelity → Phase C enhancements). The cargo + gap-hunt backlogs it draws from = [`docs/PORT_PLAN.md`](docs/PORT_PLAN.md) Part V (cargo-forensics) + Part W (gap-hunt). Start with UPGRADE_PLAN, not the raw backlogs.

## 3. Don't preempt brand cleanup

Pacred is splitting from **PCS CARGO + TTP + ไอแต้ม**. References to these survive in code because some APIs are still "borrowed" interim. **Do not scrub these references** until ก๊อต confirms the matching API switchover. The rule lives in [`docs/runbook/pcs-scrub-plan.md`](docs/runbook/pcs-scrub-plan.md).

## 4. V2 ≠ V3 — don't refactor mid-flight

This repo (`pacred-web`) is **V2**. [ADR-0017](docs/decisions/0017-pacred-faithful-pcs-port.md) supersedes [ADR-0010](docs/decisions/0010-v2-v3-version-strategy.md)'s "V2 = rebuilt owner-pleaser" framing — **V2 is now the faithful PCS port** (D1, see §0). V3 (`pacred-DPX`, separate future repo) is **unaffected** by D1. When tempted to refactor toward your ideal V3 architecture, append to `docs/v3-wishlist.md` instead. Don't ship V3 redesigns into V2.

## 5. Push at save-points only

Commit local freely. Push only when: end of session · before sleep · machine change · location change · big batch done. Per [memory: push_frequency_strict] + [`docs/team.md`](docs/team.md) §3.0. Vercel build cost + push churn distracts the team.

## 6. Customer-visible surfaces have a voice — and a phone

Slogan: **"เร็ว ไว ไม่มีคำว่าทำไม่ได้"**. Copy ตรงเป้า ไม่อ้อม. Every service has a landing page (even if backend not ready → use "ติดต่อทีม" CTA fallback). Don't ship dry copy.

**Mobile-first is non-negotiable.** Most Pacred customers arrive on phones — so every customer-visible change must be designed and checked at a phone viewport (360px Android / 390px iPhone) FIRST, then scaled up to desktop. Build desktop-first and the mobile layout goes wrong. Before pushing any customer surface, verify at 360 + 390px: no horizontal scroll, tap targets ≥ 44px, body text ≥ 16px, primary CTA thumb-reachable. The concrete rules + Tailwind patterns + pitfalls live in [`docs/conventions.md`](docs/conventions.md) §11 and the [`docs/mobile-first-playbook.md`](docs/mobile-first-playbook.md).

## 7. Constants live in `components/seo/site.ts`

Company info (phone / email / address / legal name / tax ID / slogan / LINE OA / social) **must be imported** from this single source. Never hardcode. If you spot hardcoded values, flag them via `L-contact-refactor` tracker in PORT_PLAN.

## 8. Never break the autonomous run

When the user says "จัดมาเลย / รันยาวๆ / ลุยเลย" → pick recommended defaults, don't ask mid-run, save-points-only pushes (per `autonomous_long_runs` memory). The check-in pattern is `AskUserQuestion` only when there's a load-bearing branch you can't infer.

---

## 9. Skills are playbooks — invoke them

The `.claude/skills/` directory contains 16 skills (see [`.claude/skills/INDEX.md`](.claude/skills/INDEX.md)):

- `debug-mantra` — every bug session starts here: reproduce → fail path → falsify → breadcrumb (no fix before reliable repro)
- `management-talk` — translate engineer-to-engineer content for the channel (JIRA / Slack / standup / email / meeting) — for "report ส่งพี่ป๊อป"
- `phase-verify-loop` — close every phase with assume → check → verify → analyze → fix
- `bug-swarm-loop` — hard bug? Spawn 4-5 hunter sub-agents in parallel
- `audit-kpi-dashboard` — generate dashboards from operational data
- `test-coverage-writer` — write unit + integration tests systematically
- `refactor-readability` — refactor without behavior change
- `performance-hunter` — measured perf fixes, never blind
- `scholar-immortal` — capture every learning to `docs/learnings/` (knowledge compounds)
- `copyist-unlimited` — clone templates at scale (N variants)
- `legacy-php-sweep` — port from `/Users/dev/Desktop/pcs-realshit/REALSHITDATAPCS/pcsc/public_html/` (canonical 2026-05-24 extract, ~25GB) to Pacred Next.js
- `qa-flow-simulator` — agent simulates a user journey end-to-end, asserts the real outcome (not just a 200)
- `branch-integrate-loop` — consolidate teammate branches into `dave-pacred` safely (integrate → verify → distribute)
- `mobile-first-verify` — render a customer surface at 360/390px + assert it's mobile-clean before pushing
- `legacy-fidelity-check` — audit a D1 port screen against its legacy PCS original before shipping (the owner's "copy 100% first" gate)
- `landing-conversion-audit` — pre-flight a landing page for conversion + tracking + Quality-Score before ads point at it

When a situation matches a skill's description → invoke via the Skill tool (`skill: <name>`). Or describe the situation and let the harness match.

## 10. Capture learnings (immortal scholar)

Every time you learn something tricky — a Next 16 gotcha, a Vercel surprise, a working solution after debugging, a partner-API quirk — write to `docs/learnings/<topic>.md` per the `scholar-immortal` SKILL.md protocol. Even small entries compound. Pacred-specific knowledge that no LLM training has = our moat.

## 11. Production deploy gate — `next start` smoke, not just `pnpm verify`

`pnpm verify` (lint/tsc/test/audit) and `pnpm build` passing does **not** prove pages work in production — none of them execute a real render, and a route can 500 at request time while `build` exits 0. `next dev` masks it too (always renders dynamically). This is how the 2026-05-16 `DYNAMIC_SERVER_USAGE` 500 reached prod.

**Before any deploy to `main`:** `pnpm build && pnpm start`, then `curl` every NEW or CHANGED route (especially dynamic `[param]` routes) — each must return 200 (or an intended 3xx/404). A 500 there = a 500 in production. Full procedure: "Production smoke gate" in [`.claude/skills/phase-verify-loop/SKILL.md`](.claude/skills/phase-verify-loop/SKILL.md).

**The route smoke is necessary but NOT sufficient — it cannot detect a dead database.** Public pages degrade to `200` and protected pages `307`-redirect *before* any DB query, so "every route → 200/307, zero 500s" passed even against a deleted Supabase project on launch day (`docs/learnings/ci-and-deploy-gotchas.md`). To gate a deploy, also run the [`qa-flow-simulator`](.claude/skills/qa-flow-simulator/SKILL.md) skill (asserts a real DB row / balance delta — the functional quality gate) or probe the DB directly: `curl https://<ref>.supabase.co/auth/v1/health` (live → `401 no apikey`; deleted → NXDOMAIN).

**Pattern rule:** a page under a dynamic segment (`[slug]`/`[port]`/`[id]`) that renders `<NavBar>` (or anything reading cookies/auth) MUST have `export const dynamic = "force-dynamic"` — else `DYNAMIC_SERVER_USAGE` 500. See [`docs/learnings/nextjs-16-quirks.md`](docs/learnings/nextjs-16-quirks.md).

**Prod DATA-mutation scripts — dry-run + backup FIRST, then `--apply`.** Any script that writes prod (provisioning, mass-UPDATE, deletes) MUST default to dry-run and be run dry first — the printed plan is the gate, not a guess. On 2026-06-02 a dry-run caught a reset/clear script that would have DELETED the 12 freshly-provisioned admins (its keep-set was hardcoded to the 3 pre-existing). Write a restorable backup before destructive ops (the adminIDSale→center reset dumped a JSON + a restore snippet). And **a `"use server"` file may only export async functions** — `export const X = {...}`/array compiles under tsc but crashes the page at runtime (blank screen), caught only by `pnpm build` or a browser render (margin-monitor, 2026-06-02) → browser-render-verify after merging admin/page code, not just tsc.

## 12. Docs: every `.md` ≤ 2000 lines · no duplication

- **Hard cap: every `.md` file ≤ 2000 lines.** If a file would exceed it, split into a new file and cross-link both ways — never let one file grow past the cap. Agents read docs into a context window; oversized files truncate mid-content.
- **One canonical home per fact — no duplication.** Information lives in exactly ONE file; everywhere else links to it. When you edit a doc and spot the same content duplicated elsewhere, delete the copy and leave a link. Dedup what you touch.
- Detail in [`docs/conventions.md`](docs/conventions.md) §13.

## 13. Worktree base is stale — resync to `dave-pacred` before trusting it

A `git worktree` (including the `.claude/worktrees/*` one a session or a spawned `isolation: "worktree"` agent runs in) is **cut from a point-in-time snapshot, and `origin/HEAD` points at `origin/main`** — the *held* production branch, which on this team lags the live integration branch `dave-pacred` by dozens of commits. Acting on a stale base re-derives fixes that already exist, fails task premises ("file X is missing" when X is on `dave-pacred`), and sets up merge conflicts.

**Rule — at session start (this is §1's `git fetch` step) and in every spawn prompt for a worktree agent:**
```bash
git fetch origin && git merge origin/dave-pacred --no-edit && git log --oneline -3
```
- If a task says "X is broken/missing on `dave-pacred`" but `ls`/`find` can't see X → **stop and reconcile branch ages**, don't "fix" a phantom. `git show origin/dave-pacred:<file>` to inspect the live trunk.
- When you spawn a worktree-isolation agent, the spawn prompt MUST tell it to resync to `dave-pacred` first — otherwise it surveys `origin/main` and reports a stale picture.

Three separate sessions lost time to this; full detail + recovery steps in [`docs/learnings/ci-and-deploy-gotchas.md`](docs/learnings/ci-and-deploy-gotchas.md).
