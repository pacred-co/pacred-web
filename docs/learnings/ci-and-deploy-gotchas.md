## [2026-05-15] CI fails with `ERR_PNPM_BAD_PM_VERSION`

**Context:** Pushed commit `f06c394` to `main`; GitHub Actions CI run #23 failed immediately at the "Install pnpm" step.

**Symptom:** Install step throws:
```
Error: Multiple versions of pnpm specified:
  - version 11 in the GitHub Action config with the key "version"
  - version pnpm@11.0.9 in the package.json with the key "packageManager"
```
All subsequent steps (Setup Node / Install deps / Lint / Typecheck / Unit tests / Audit) show 0s — none ran.

**Root cause:** `pnpm/action-setup@v4` (current version on GitHub) rejects double-specification. `.github/workflows/ci.yml` had `with: version: 11` AND `package.json` had `"packageManager": "pnpm@11.0.9"`.

**Fix:** Removed `with: version: 11` from `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. Kept `packageManager` in `package.json` as single source of truth — Corepack reads from there too, so dev + CI use the same pnpm.

```yaml
# After fix
- name: Install pnpm
  uses: pnpm/action-setup@v4
  # No `version` — read from packageManager in package.json
```

Commit: `fa9dc5f`.

**Why this matters next time:** If you ever upgrade pnpm in `package.json`, the workflow needs **no** matching change. Conversely, if you see this error → check both places + dedupe (delete the `with: version`).

**Cross-links:**
- Commit `fa9dc5f` "fix(ci): drop pnpm version from action-setup"
- [`.claude/skills/phase-verify-loop/SKILL.md`](../../.claude/skills/phase-verify-loop/SKILL.md) — uses this as its worked example

## [2026-05-15] Vercel deploy lag vs push (browser shows stale)

**Context:** Pushed merge `1d3e0d0` (podeng customs v2) → user immediately checked `pacred.co.th/customs-clearance-shipping-suvarnabhumi` → saw OLD banner without "1 ชม." stamp.

**Symptom:** Code in `main` clearly has the v2 banner. Production URL still serves v1.

**Root cause:** Vercel build is async — 2-5 min build + edge cache invalidation 1-2 min. The user checked before that finished.

**Fix (no code change needed):** Wait. Hard-refresh (`Ctrl+Shift+R`) clears browser cache. Check Vercel dashboard → Deployments → look for the commit hash + "Ready" status.

**Why this matters next time:** Whenever the user reports "I pushed and the page didn't update":
1. Check the commit ACTUALLY made it to `origin/main` (`git log origin/main`)
2. Check Vercel: is the corresponding deploy "Ready"? (could be Building / Error)
3. Hard-refresh the user's browser
4. Try incognito tab
5. Only then dig into code

Don't dive into the source first. 90% of the time it's deploy lag or cache.

**Why this matters for pacred.co.th specifically:** If `pacred.co.th` is on a SEPARATE Vercel project than `pacred.co`, they deploy independently. Check Vercel Domains tab → both should point to the same project.

**Cross-links:**
- `.claude/skills/phase-verify-loop/SKILL.md` — step 1 ASSUME should include "Vercel deploy completed for HEAD commit"

## [2026-05-15] `pnpm audit` shadowed by built-in security audit

**Context:** Wrote custom audit script umbrella, named it `audit` in package.json scripts.

**Symptom:** `pnpm audit` ran pnpm's BUILT-IN security advisory check, not custom umbrella. Custom script never fired.

**Root cause:** `pnpm audit` is a reserved built-in command — it wins namespace over package.json scripts.

**Fix:** Renamed custom script to `audit:all`. All callers + CI workflow updated.

**Why this matters next time:** When naming custom scripts, avoid: `audit`, `install`, `add`, `remove`, `update`, `dlx`, `exec`, `run`, `publish`, `pack`, `version`, `view`, `link`, `unlink`. Use suffixes (`audit:all`, `install:strict`) when you want pnpm-namespace-safe.

**Cross-links:**
- Commit (in git history search for "rename audit to audit:all")
