# 📚 Pacred Learnings — index

> Every agent / dev / session that learns something tricky writes it here.
> Future agents read this BEFORE re-discovering. Knowledge compounds.

> **Skill that writes here:** [`.claude/skills/scholar-immortal/`](../../.claude/skills/scholar-immortal/SKILL.md)
> **Protocol:** read SKILL.md; add a dated entry to the right topic file (or create a new topic file + add to this index).

Last reviewed: 2026-05-19 (pacred-domain-knowledge +1 + php-port-patterns +1 — ภูม's legacy PCS Cargo system research captured: 4 verbatim files copied to `docs/research/pcs-legacy/`, the durable business logic synthesized — 3 revenue services + `tb_*` schema + `sStatus`/`fStatus`/`wType` enums + chargeable-weight & service-fee formulas + VIP-credit & agent-commission rules + the forwarder pay-at-status-5 post-arrival COD inversion; port-mechanics facts: legacy status columns are numeric VARCHAR strings, the forwarder uses per-status DATETIME columns not a history table, `tb_wallet.wBalance` is a stored running balance). 2026-05-19 (php-port-patterns +1 — MySQL→PostgreSQL via pgloader: connects to MySQL 9.x with no `caching_sha2` workaround; one CAST rule kills the zero-date NOT-NULL trap; MySQL collation is case-INSENSITIVE so join-key columns must be case-normalised in the port; `notnull`/`isnull` are PG postfix operators not bare aliases; a Supabase data load needs the Postgres DB password — REST API keys can't run DDL/COPY). 2026-05-18 (php-port-patterns +1 — MySQL→PostgreSQL data-migration gotchas: NUL bytes in legacy `varchar` break a Postgres `COPY`; legacy `datetime NOT NULL` columns hold `0000-00-00` so temporal columns must port NULLABLE; convert via a live local MySQL not dump-text-munging. 2026-05-17 — nextjs-16-quirks +1 — a `server-only` module reaching a Client Component transitively breaks `next build` but passes `tsc`/`verify`; ci-and-deploy-gotchas +1 — worktree smoke needs `.env.local` + rebuild; supabase-rls-patterns +1 — `wallet.balance` is pending-blind, spend gates must use the available-balance helper; ci-and-deploy-gotchas +1 — a "bug on branch `dave`" can be a stale-worktree phantom, verify against the live `dave` worktree; ci-and-deploy-gotchas +1 — worktree-isolation agents you spawn branch from `origin/main`, brief them to resync to `dave`; ci-and-deploy-gotchas +1 — a `next start` + curl smoke does NOT detect a dead database, public pages degrade + protected pages redirect before the DB call)

## Related research (full evidence, not learnings)

Learnings are *synthesized* — for the raw source material a synthesis draws from:

| Research | What it is |
|---|---|
| [`docs/research/pcs-legacy/`](../research/pcs-legacy/_index.md) | ภูม's 4-file verbatim decode of the legacy **PCS Cargo** PHP system (business flow · full `tb_*` schema · staff guidebook · dev docs) — the SOT for the D1 1:1 port. Synthesized into `pacred-domain-knowledge.md` (2026-05-19) + `php-port-patterns.md`. |
| [`docs/research/`](../research/_index.md) | The wider R&D / audit / gap-hunt folder. |

## How to add an entry

```bash
# 1. Pick the right topic file. Create new if no fit.
# 2. Append to the END (chronological — never replace, never edit past entries).
# 3. Use the template from .claude/skills/scholar-immortal/SKILL.md.
# 4. Commit:
git commit -m "docs(learnings): <topic> — <short summary>"
```

## Re-read cadence

- **Every session start** — scan this index for any new topic / date you haven't seen.
- **Before fixing a bug** — grep `docs/learnings/` for the symptom keywords (see `bug-swarm-loop` hunter 5).
- **Weekly** — เดฟ skim through new entries on Friday integration window.

## Patterns to look for over time

As entries accumulate, watch for:
- **Repeated entries on same topic** → the underlying issue is systemic; consider an ADR or refactor
- **Topics that haven't gained entries** → either the area is stable OR no one's working there (worth investigating which)
- **Entries that contradict each other** → behavior changed; mark older entry as superseded with a forward pointer

## Why this directory exists

The user (เดฟ) described it as: *"นักปราชญ์ผู้เป็นอมตะ"* — immortal scholar. Every learning persists. Future Claude Code sessions inherit. Pacred-specific knowledge that no LLM training has = our compounding moat.
